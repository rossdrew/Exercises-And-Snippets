# Code Snippets

These are code snippets from the book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce A. Tate](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

They are here because I have the Kindle edition which messes up formatting and I'd like to be able to access these snippets wherever I am with my Kindle.

These code snippets are publicly availiable [here](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) but I do not own them, I didn't write them and I have made no adjustments to them.
